# Wafer Defect Type Classification

This repo is a CNN-based algorightm implementation for wafer defect type classification.


## Download Dataset

To get the dataset, first download gdown:
```bash
pip install gdown
```

Then run:
```bash
gdown 17NgVpIwypwkD7Cmu9MpwioDXAi9GtxwL
```

The dataset should be put in the root directory.

## Usage

Just run the `wafer_defect.ipynb` and install necessary dependencies. The `pytorch_version.ipynb` is the same as `wafer_defect.ipynb` except that some of the models are defined in PyTorch.
